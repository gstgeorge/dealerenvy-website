        <div class="col-lg-5 my-auto">
            <p>Your photos are often the first interaction between your dealership and your customers. Dynamic Image Overlays from Dealer Solutions leverages this to bring strategic messages to your customers- right where their attention is already focused. Our designs feature a clean and minimalistic style which compliments your vehicles and creates a professional representation of your inventory.</p>
            <p class="mb-1">Some common overlay types include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Manufacturer Logo</li>
                <li>Financial Incentive Ad</li>
                <li>Certified Pre-Owned</li>
                <li>CarFax 1-Owner</li>
                <li>Loaner/Demo</li>
                <li>Electric or Hybrid Vehicles</li>
                <li>Fuel-Saving (high MPG) Vehicles</li>
                <li>Fleet Sales</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This approach allows you to convey important details that can sway a buyer's decision, such as exclusive financing offers. For instance, highlighting a 0% APR Financing option can be a compelling incentive that sets your dealership apart from others, especially when your buyer is on a 3rd party site like Cars.com or Autotrader, viewing your vehicles side-by-side with your competition.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">Equipped Option Tiles</h2>
        <div class="col-lg-9">
            <p>Manually typing out attention-grabbing features on each and every vehicle is now a thing of the past. Our Equipped Option Icons decode each vehicle's VIN and automatically generate a clean, stylish, set of tiles along the bottom of the first image displaying that vehicle's most desirable options.</p>
            <p>The clean and modern design conveys a sense of professionalism to your customers, leaving a lasting impression that sets your brand apart. And since they're applied to each vehicle automatically, it results in significant time savings for your BDC or sales department.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">Custom Images</h2>
        <div class="col-lg-5 my-auto">
            <p>Custom images are a great way to bring an additional message to your customers. They can be inserted at any position in a vehicle's photo set and applied either to the whole inventory, or constrained to a particular subset of vehicles.</p>
            <p class="mb-1">Some common examples of this include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Map of your dealer's location inserted as the last image on every vehicle</li>
                <li>Outline of the included warranty benefits for Certified Pre-Owned vehicles (added only to applicable vehicles)</li>
                <li>Advertisement for a free first oil change at your service department added to every New vehicle</li>
                <li>Temporary “Photos Coming Soon” placeholder image including your dealer's branding.</li>

        <div class="col-lg-5 my-auto">
            <p>Full-motion walk-around videos give your customers a more personal, in-depth, view of each vehicle- featuring a commentary which highlights specific details on that vehicle as well as your dealer's location and contact information. Videos from Dealer Solutions provide a comprehensive overview of the vehicle's features, allowing your potential customers to make informed decisions.</p>
            <p>Adding videos to your website has proven to be an effective strategy in increasing overall customer engagement. Incorporating videos on your site not only captures users' attention but also encourages them to spend more time exploring your content and products. This practice positively impacts your website's search engine optimization (SEO), ultimately enhancing your dealership's visibility and ranking in Google's search results.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">360 Spins</h2>
        <div class="col-lg-4 my-auto">
            <p>360 Spins revolutionize the way customers interact with your vehicle inventory by offering an immersive and dynamic experience. Each 360 Spin provides a view into a vehicle that static images or traditional videos might miss.</p>
            <p>The ability to navigate through a vehicle's interior and exterior with a simple click or swipe not only enhances user experience but also builds trust and transparency as customers can scrutinize the details that matter to them. This transparency fosters confidence in potential buyers, as they feel more informed about the product before even stepping foot in your showroom.</p>
            <p>Adding 360 Spins to your marketing strategy sets your dealership apart and also keeps pace with the evolving expectations of modern consumers. By providing an interactive, immersive, and visually stimulating experience, you capture attention and also leave a lasting impression.</p>
