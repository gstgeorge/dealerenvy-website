# Merchandising

## Dynamic Image Overlays

Your image overlays are your first impression to your customers. Use this to your dealer’s advantage by adding relevant info directly on your vehicles. Tell your customers that they can get 0% APR Financing, even if they’re viewing your car on AutoTrader or Cars.com where they can’t see your website’s banner ads.

Some common overlay types include:

* New w/ Manufacturer Logo
* New w/ Financial Incentive Ad
* Pre-Owned
* Certified Pre-Owned
* CarFax 1-Owner
* Fuel-Efficient Vehicles
* Electric Vehicles
* Loaner/Demo
* Fleet Sales

## Equipped Option Icons

Manually typing out an attention-grabbing footer for each and every vehicle is now a thing of the past. Equipped Option Icons will decode each vehicle’s VIN and automatically generate a clean, stylish, set of tiles along the bottom of the first image displaying that vehicle’s most desirable options.

The clean and modern design conveys a sense of professionalism to your customers, leaving a lasting impression that sets your brand apart. And since they’re applied to each vehicle automatically, it results in significant time savings for your BDC department.

You’ll also draw more attention on 3rd party sites, by showing your customers which options they’re looking for right on the thumbnail image.

## Custom Images

Custom images are a great way to bring an additional message to your customers. They can be inserted at any position in a vehicle’s photo set and applied either to the entire inventory, or only to a particular subset of vehicles.

Some common implementations of this include:

* Map of your dealer’s location inserted as the last image on every vehicle
* Outline of included warranty benefits for Certified Pre-Owned vehicles added only to applicable vehicles.
* Advertisement for a free first oil change at your service department added to every New vehicle.
* Temporary “Photos Coming Soon” placeholder image including your dealer’s branding.

## Seasonal Decorations

Make your vehicles stand out and grab your customer’s attention with temporary overlay decorations around holidays. By incorporating Dealer Solutions Seasonal Decorations you can give your vehicles a distinct and captivating look that aligns with the spirit of various holidays throughout the year. Whether it’s Halloween, Christmas, or Valentine’s Day, embracing these festive additions will help your vehicles become real head-turners, ensuring that your brand stands out from the competition.

# Videos

Our full-motion walk-around videos give your customers a more personal, in-depth, view of each vehicle featuring a commentary which highlights specific details on that vehicle as well as your dealer’s location and contact information. Videos from Dealer Solutions provide a comprehensive overview of the vehicle’s features, allowing your potential customers to make informed decisions. Our expert team focuses on capturing the vehicle’s unique characteristics, ensuring your customers get an authentic experience even before visiting your dealership.

Adding videos to your website has proven to be an effective strategy in increasing overall customer engagement. Incorporating videos on your site not only captures users’ attention but also encourages them to spend more time exploring your content and products. This practice positively impacts your website’s search engine optimization (SEO), ultimately enhancing your dealership’s visibility and ranking in Google’s search results. By implementing videos effectively, you can boost your online presence and attract more potential customers to your website, driving growth for your dealership.

Each video can also be sent to YouTube and other 3rd party sites.
